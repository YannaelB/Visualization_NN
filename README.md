# Visualization_NN
This repos contains codes for visualizing neural network learning in action. I've reused my pong game with Reinforcement Learning agent to illustrate it.

Visualization.py create a .CSV from a tensorflow model in order to create and draw a graph with the CSV and NetworkX library.
Then we define the graph shape and color according to the model prediction.

Run "Play_Ai_vs_Ai" to see the agents playing together and create .png images. Then use "Create_video_file.py" to create a video file with all the images you've created with Play_Ai_vs_Ai.py.
